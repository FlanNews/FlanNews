              <p>In a dramatic FA Cup semifinal showdown, Manchester United faced an unexpected challenge from Coventry City, nearly missing out on a spot in the final. Despite entering the game as heavy favorites, Marcus Rashford's side found themselves on the brink of defeat as Coventry mounted a stunning comeback.<br><br>

                The match began with United asserting their dominance, with Scott McTominay opening the scoring in the 23rd minute. Harry Maguire's header just before halftime seemed to cement United's control, putting them 2-0 ahead. Bruno Fernandes extended their lead to 3-0 early in the second half, seemingly putting the game out of reach. <br><br>
                
                However, Coventry refused to back down, staging a remarkable rally that caught United off guard. Ellis Simms pulled one back for Coventry in the 71st minute, giving them a glimmer of hope. Just minutes later, Callum O'Hare's deflected strike further narrowed the gap, setting the stage for a tense finale.<br><br>
                
                In a dramatic turn of events, Coventry was awarded a late penalty, which Haji Wright converted to level the score at 3-3. The Sky Blues thought they had secured victory when Simms found the net again, but VAR ruled the goal offside, sending the game to penalties.<br><br>
                
                The penalty shootout was a rollercoaster of emotions, with both teams experiencing highs and lows. United goalkeeper Andre Onana made a crucial save from Casemiro's penalty, giving United hope. However, Coventry regained the advantage before United's Bruno Fernandes equalized from the spot.<br><br>
                
                Heartbreak followed for Coventry as Ben Sheaf missed his penalty, leaving Rasmus Hojlund with the chance to seal the win for United. The Norwegian made no mistake, securing a dramatic victory and sending United through to the final.<br><br>
                
                The match showcased the unpredictability of football, with United's early dominance giving way to a thrilling comeback from Coventry. Despite facing adversity, United showed resilience and composure in the shootout to secure their place in the final against Manchester City.
