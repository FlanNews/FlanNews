              <p>David Pecker, former chairman of the parent company of the National Enquirer, is anticipated to be the initial witness summoned by the Manhattan district attorney's office in the impending criminal trial regarding hush money linked to ex-President Donald Trump, as per a source acquainted with the arrangements. <br><br>
                Pecker played a pivotal role in an alleged plot to pay hush money to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, purportedly to conceal her alleged affair with Trump prior to the 2016 presidential election. <br><br>
                Following the commencement of opening statements, which are scheduled to commence on Monday, the DA's office is projected to call upon him. The New York Times initially reported this prospective witness.<br><br>
                As the former chairman and CEO of American Media Inc., Pecker was involved in various "catch-and-kill" arrangements executed on Trump's behalf. <br><br>
                Daniels and Cohen are also expected to testify during the trial, according to sources previously cited by CNN. <br><br>
                AMI itself wasn't subjected to criminal charges but did acknowledge making the payment to McDougal. The company settled with the Federal Election Commission, agreeing to pay a $187,500 fine for making an unlawful campaign contribution. <br><br>
                Pecker has been granted immunity in exchange for his testimony, while AMI has entered into a non-prosecution agreement with prosecutors.</p>
