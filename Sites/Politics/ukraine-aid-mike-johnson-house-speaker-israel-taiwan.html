            <div class="text">
              <p>The day following Iran's assault on Israel, House Speaker Mike Johnson found himself in a pivotal conversation with House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, a discussion that, until now, has not been disclosed. In this conversation, Johnson expressed his readiness to take action on foreign aid, despite the potential backlash from Republicans who opposed additional assistance to Ukraine, which could jeopardize his position, according to a source familiar with the exchange. <br><br>

                Jeffries pressed Johnson on his ability to garner Republican support for aid to Ukraine, as House Democrats would need to secure the rest, the source added.<br><br>
                
                Upon returning to Washington, DC, Johnson faced a barrage of criticism from many of his GOP colleagues, particularly hardline conservatives. It became evident to Johnson that his strategy of holding separate votes on aid for Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, then merging them into one package without addressing conservative demands regarding border policies, could prompt a motion to remove him as speaker.<br><br>
                
                On Tuesday, Johnson found himself inundated with complaints and demands from fellow Republicans. By evening, grappling with the weight of his decision and the scrutiny of history, Johnson, a devout Christian, turned to prayer.<br><br>
                
                “He was torn between trying to save his job and do the right thing,” said House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, who was with Johnson before the legislation was unveiled. “He prayed over it.”<br><br>
                
                Despite the pressure, Johnson ultimately stood firm in his belief that providing aid to Ukraine was the right course of action, a decision that led to tense exchanges on the House floor as Republican members clashed, with Johnson navigating the discord.<br><br>
                
                In a message to colleagues preceding the release of legislative text, Johnson acknowledged the considerable feedback received. Publicly, he stated, “My philosophy is do the right thing and let the chips fall where they may. If I operated out of fear over motion to vacate, I would never be able to do my job.”<br><br>
                
                The aid package, amounting to $95 billion and endorsed by President Joe Biden, passed with bipartisan support but also drew admonishment from Johnson towards Democrats waving Ukrainian flags on the House floor after the bill's passage.<br><br>
                
                Johnson's backing of Ukraine aid marks a significant shift, considering his previous vote against funding for the country. Sources indicate that influential Republican voices, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, emphasized the urgency of supporting Ukraine in its conflict against Russia.<br><br>
                
                Recent developments, including a key intelligence briefing from CIA Director Bill Burns, further influenced Johnson's decision. Additionally, the impending enrollment of his oldest son in the Naval Academy underscored the gravity of the situation for Johnson.<br><br>
                
                Facing threats of a motion to oust him as speaker from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and her supporters, Johnson may depend on Democratic support to retain his position, although he maintains he hasn't solicited their assistance.<br><br>
                
                While Johnson's decision to support Ukraine aid has garnered bipartisan backing, some hardliners caution that his reliance on Democrats could be politically precarious in the long run.</p>
