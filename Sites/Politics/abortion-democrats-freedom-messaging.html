            <div class="text">
              <p>When Vice President Kamala Harris hurried to Arizona after the state Supreme Court upheld a law dating back to 1864 that effectively bans abortion, she kicked off her speech with a clear statement: “This fight is about freedom, and the freedom that is fundamental to the promise of America.”<br><br>

                In a recent abortion-focused ad aired by the Biden campaign in Arizona, President Joe Biden solemnly questions: “If Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?”<br><br>
                
                For Biden, Harris, and fellow Democrats to emphasize “freedom” in this campaign marks a notable shift in roles. For nearly 90 years, since the New Deal era, Republicans have typically framed their agenda around advancing “freedom” and “liberty,” while Democrats have often highlighted concepts like “equality” and “justice.”<br><br>
                
                Republicans haven’t relinquished their efforts to claim the mantle of freedom. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, for instance, has frequently used the term to criticize COVID-19 restrictions and what he perceives as leftist ideologies. Similarly, Trump has criticized Biden’s push for electric vehicles as an assault on Americans’ freedom to choose gas-powered vehicles. <br><br>
                
                Yet, the recent wave of red-state laws restricting abortion and reproductive healthcare has provided Democrats with an opportunity to reshape this enduring debate over freedom, according to many analysts.<br><br>
                
                Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute, notes that historically, Republicans have anchored their worldview in liberty, emphasizing freedoms such as gun ownership, religious practice, and limited government intervention. However, Democrats are now redefining the concept of freedom.<br><br>
                
                This shift is particularly crucial for Biden, as polls consistently show Trump with a significant lead on handling the economy. To win, Biden needs to persuade voters who trust Trump's economic policies to vote against him. The interconnected issues of rights, values, and democracy present Biden's best chance to do so.<br><br>
                
                Biden has centered the theme of freedom in his campaign messaging, asserting that personal freedom is central to American identity. He warns of the threat posed by "MAGA extremists" to core freedoms, including abortion rights, voting rights, and LGBTQ rights.<br><br>
                
                Harris has echoed this message, highlighting various issues such as racial history education and gun violence prevention as essential components of freedom.<br><br>
                
                Liberal groups like Way to Win have long advocated for emphasizing freedom in Democratic messaging, linking issues like abortion to broader narratives about rights and freedoms. They argue that portraying Trump and his allies as threats to freedom can resonate with a wide range of voters.<br><br>
                
                Despite Democratic efforts, polling suggests a split among the public regarding which party is trusted to defend basic rights and freedoms. Republicans are more likely to emphasize threats to personal liberties, while Democrats prioritize issues like reproductive rights.<br><br>
                
                The debate over freedom is complex and evolving, influenced by societal attitudes and political framing. While Democrats may face challenges mobilizing certain segments of their coalition, recent events like the Dobbs decision have heightened the salience of rights and freedoms, particularly among younger voters and women.<br><br>
                
                For libertarians, the current struggle between Biden and Republicans over the idea of freedom presents both amusement and frustration. While both parties have shortcomings in promoting freedom, issues like Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election highlight fundamental differences in their approach to governance.</p>
