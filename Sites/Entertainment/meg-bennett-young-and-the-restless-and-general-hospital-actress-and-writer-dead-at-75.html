              <p>Meg Bennett, a seasoned television writer and performer, passed away on April 11 at the age of 75. Bennett, renowned for her contributions to popular soap operas like The Bold and the Beautiful and General Hospital, as well as for her acting roles on various soaps including The Young and the Restless, succumbed to cancer after a brave battle.<br><br>

                Born Helen Bennett and raised in Pasadena, California, she pursued her love for acting by studying drama at Northwestern University. Initially entering the entertainment industry through modeling, Bennett gained prominence when she landed the role of the "Cadillac Eldorado Convertible Girl" in 1971, leading her to New York City where she embarked on a Broadway career featuring productions like Godspell and Grease.<br><br>
                
                Her breakthrough in television came with the role of Liza on the daytime soap opera Search for Tomorrow, a character she portrayed for three years. Later, she graced screens as Julie Newman on The Young and the Restless for six years, showcasing her talent not only in acting but also in scriptwriting. Her adeptness with script notes eventually led her to transition into a full-time writing career while continuing to act. <br><br>
                
                Bennett made significant contributions as a writer to various soap operas including The Bold and the Beautiful, Generations, Sunset Beach, Santa Barbara, and General Hospital, where she also had memorable acting stints. Her exceptional writing on General Hospital earned her a Daytime Emmy Award in 1995 for Outstanding Drama Series Writing Team.<br><br>
                
                In her personal life, Bennett is survived by her husband Robert Guza Jr., a fellow writer for General Hospital, whom she married nearly 20 years ago. Together, they co-created the soap opera Sunset Beach. Additionally, she is survived by two stepdaughters and four grandchildren. Throughout her life, Bennett remained deeply devoted to her family, her craft, and her passion for working with children.</p><br><br>
